**_GetRecced_** (known as **gitrecced** on github) is an Android media recommendation application that connects its users to more movies, TV shows, and books based on like users' preferences. Developed over the course of 5 weeks as the Facebook University project of Tiffany ([tyu91](https://github.com/tyu91)), Tomoka ([TK000](https://github.com/TK000)), and X ([Morefiendz](https://github.com/Morefiendz)), we brought our unique visions together in order to design a sleek Android application that unites people through a shared passion for media.
